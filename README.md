React-Redux-Recipes AKA Recipe Pirate is a SPA that encourages users to make the recipes they can search in the SPA and comment and let the Cap'n (me/you) know how good the recipe is and how it can be improved.

Description: Recipe Pirate is a simple single page application utilizing Rails as the backend and React-Redux as the front end, with tons of room to grow more functionality. The app was made with a bit of whimsy hoping to engage the user to search by a keyword, find a recipe that peaked their interests and comment on it with a review letting the curator of the recipes know their opinion.

Getting Started: CD to a directory and run bundle install.
